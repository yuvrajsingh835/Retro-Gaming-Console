# Retro-Gaming-Console

This project involved designing and building a custom gaming console that emulates classic video games. Utilizing tools like Fusion 360 for design and 3D printing for the consoleâ€™s body, I integrated ESP32 dev module and used libraries like U8g2lib.h, Adafruit_SSD1306.h and Adafruit_GFX.h. This console not only brings back the nostalgia of retro gaming but also showcases my skills in electronics, programming, and 3D design.
